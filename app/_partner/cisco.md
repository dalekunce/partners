  desc: The American Red Cross is a member of the Measles & Rubella Initiative, which
    seeks to eliminate these diseases. We will be conducting a measles campaign in
    Malawi in spring 2017. This task will create a basemap of the area in order to
    help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection
    and field mapping in the areas.

  desc: Mugumu is the capital of Serengeti district in eastern Tanzania and the surrounding
    villages have a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, early marriage
    and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential
    area data to facilitate their outreach work. We need to complete this map by mid
    November so we can print out paper maps ready for the next FGM cutting season
    in December.
