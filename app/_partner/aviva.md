  desc: Clinton Health Access Initiative is supporting the National Malaria program
    in Honduras to eliminate malaria by 2020. Last year Honduras reported approximately
    3,500 cases, down from nearly 10,000 in 2010. Still, Honduras reports the second
    highest number of cases across Central America. Honduras plans to reach elimination
    by strengthening surveillance, improving case management, and targeting vector
    control interventions. The municipality of Puerto Lempira, located in the Mosquitia
    region and characterized by indigenous and remote communities, is among those
    at highest risk in the country. Movement through this region occurs mostly by
    foot, canoe, and plane.
