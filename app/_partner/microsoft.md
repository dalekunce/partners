  desc: Mugumu is the capital of Serengeti district in eastern Tanzania and the surrounding
    villages have a very high incidence of Female Genital Mutilation, early marriage
    and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential
    area data to facilitate their outreach work. We need to complete this map by mid
    November so we can print out paper maps ready for the next FGM cutting season
    in December.

  desc: The National Malaria Programme in Botswana and the Clinton Health Access Initiative
    are working with the Missing Maps team to comprehensively build a footprint map
    to aid upcoming malaria control and elimination field work in 2016, as part of
    a final push at the total elimination of malaria. Botswana is well-positioned
    to be one of the first countries in southern Africa to eliminate malaria in the
    next few years. In 2015, Botswana reported 276 cases of malaria countrywide, a
    number that reduced from a staggering 8,056 in 2000 thanks to the scale-up of
    effective interventions and surveillance in the communities.

  desc: The American Red Cross is a member of the Measles & Rubella Initiative, which
    seeks to eliminate these diseases. We will be conducting a measles campaign in
    Malawi in spring 2017. This task will create a basemap of the area in order to
    help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection
    and field mapping in the areas.
